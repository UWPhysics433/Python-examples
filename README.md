## Python-examples
Example notebooks showing how to do different things with Python and associated libraries.

### [A brief tour of Python & some libraries](https://github.com/UWPhysics433/Python-examples/blob/main/A%20brief%20tour%20of%20Python%20%26%20some%20libraries.ipynb)
This gives an overview of some aspects of the Python language that may be unfamiliar to those who have learned other programming languages, such as mutable versus immutable data types, the concept and features of "objects" as a data structure, and a few examples to illustrate.
Then the notebook gives some quick examples of how to read data sets into Python, how to plot and fit a simple line, how to plot with error bars, and finally how to fit a line with full uncertainty calculations.
